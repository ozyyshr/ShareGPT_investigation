{"user query": "Hi let's do a technical interviewSimulate rain drops on a 1 meter wide walk way. Each rain drop is going to cover 1 centimeter of the walkway. Assume that a rain drop randomly falls from any position within the meter and falls straight down. Find out how many rain drops it takes to wet the whole walkway.So what if some of them overlap?That doesn't make sense. What if all 100 of the raindrops fell at the leftmost position?Yes, and can you provide an algorithm in any programming language that simulates this?Why are you adding the raindrop size? What if multiple raindrops fall at the same location?Why are you generating drop positions with random integers? The question stated that a rain drop falls randomly from ANY position within the meter. Randomly generating integers would not ever produce positions like 1.5.Why would this work? Suppose the random position was 99.9. Your algorithm would consider it to have made wet the area from 99 to 100, which is not correct. A 1 centimeter rain drop falling at 99.9 would only make the area from 99.4 to 100.4 wet.How would that fix the problem? Truncating a floating point number to an int would change 99.4 to 99 again, just like your previous proposal. The area from 99 to 99.4 would not be made wet by a rain drop at 99.9.", "label": "technical interview, algorithm design, problem-solving", "domain": "technology, programming", "summary": "Discuss and provide an algorithm for a raindrop simulation problem."}
